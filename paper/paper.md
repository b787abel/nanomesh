# Summary

Nanomesh is a Python library that allows users to quickly and easily create 2D and 3D meshes directly from images of the object they wish to mesh. The automated workflow can apply filtering to smooth the original image, segment the picture to extract different regions and create conforming meshes of the objects. Analysis tools allow to evaluate the quality of the resuting mesh and detect problematic regions. The resulting meshes can be exported to a variety of popular formats so that they can be used in finite element simulations. Nanomesh can be used as python library for example in Jupyter notebooks, or though dedicated online dashboards.

# Statement of need

Finite element methods (FEM) often require the creation of non-regular meshes that represents the topology and physical properties of the object under examination. Many meshing libraries exist and allows to create such meshes. Most of these solutions are however proprietary with sometimes a substantial fee because of the level of certification they require for example for medical or engineering applications (e.g. Centaur, ScanIP). Some open source libraries do exist but often create meshes from a CAD design or well defined primitive (e.g. GMSH, CGAL). While these meshing libraries are invaluable for the study of idealized systems they do not allow the mesh to account for potential defects in the underlying topology of the object.

For example, the calculation of the optical properties of nanocrystals is usually performed with an ideal nano-structure as substrate for the propagation of the Maxwell equations [@Koenderink2005; @Hughes2005]. Such simulations provide very valuable insight but ignore the effect that manufacturing imprecision of the nanometer-sized pores can have on the overall properties of the crystal. To resolve such structure-property relationship, meshes conforming to experimental images of real nanocrystlals are needed. The subsequent simulation of wave propagation through these meshes using any FEM solver leads to a better understanding of the the impact that imperfections may have on the overall properties. Similar use cases in different fields of material science and beyond are expected. The direct FEM simulations on real device topology might bring very valuable insights. Through its user friendliness, code qualitiy, nanomesh will enable scientist running advanced simulations on mesh that accurately represents the devices that are created in experimental labs.

# Workflow and class hierarchy

A large part of the work of generating a mesh is to pre-process, filter, and segment the image data to generate a contour that accurately describes the objects of interest.

\autoref{fig:flowchart} shows the Nanomesh workflow from left to right. Data is read in from a 2D or 3D `numpy` array [@numpy] into an `Image` object. Nanomesh has dedicated classes (`Mesher`s) to generate contours and triangulate or tetrahedralize the image data.

Meshes are stored in MeshContainers, this is an overarching data class that contains a single set of coordinates with multiple cell types. This is useful for storing the output from triangulation as well as the contour used to generate it or object boundaries. Dedicated Mesh types contain methods to work with the underlying data structure directly.

# Example

To illustrate how Nananomesh was designed with this workflow in mind, we present an example to create 2D and 3D meshes of nanopores etched in a silicon matrix. These nanopores are very often used in the creation of optical crystals and the study of their properties is therefore crucial.

Nanomesh works with `numpy` arrays. The following snippet uses some sample data included with Nanomesh and loads it into an `Image` object. \autoref{fig:flowchart} shows the input image as output by the snippet below.

```python
from nanomesh import Image, data

image_array = data.nanopores()
plane = Image(image_array)
plane.show()
```

## Filter and segment the data

Image segmentation is a way to label the pixels of different regions of interest in an image. In this example, we are interested in separating the silicon bulk material (bright) from the nanopores (dark).

Common filters and image operations like Gaussian filter are available as a method on the `Image` object directly. Nanomesh uses `scikit-image` [@skimage] for image operations. Other image operations can be applied using the `.apply()` method, which guarantees an object of the same time will be returned. For example, the code below is essentially short-hand for `plane_gauss = plane.apply(skimage.filters.gaussian, sigma=5)`.

```python
plane_gauss = plane.gaussian(sigma=5)
```

The next step is to segment the image using a threshold method. In this case, we use the `li` method, because it appears to give good separation.

```python
thresh = plane_gauss.threshold('li')
segmented = plane_gauss.digitize(bins=[thresh])
```

## Generate mesh

Meshes are generated using the `Mesher` class. Meshing consists of two steps:

1. Contour finding
2. Triangulation

Contour finding uses the marching cubes algorithm implemented in `scikit-image` [@skimage] to wrap all the pores in a polygon. `max_edge_dist=5` splits up long edges in the contour, so that no two points are further than 5 pixels apart. `level` specifies the level at which the contour is generated. Here, we set it to the threshold value determined above.

\autoref{fig:mesh_plots} shows the output of `mesh.plot_contour()`, a comparison of the guassian filtered image with the contours.

```python
from nanomesh import Mesher

mesher = Mesher(plane_gauss)
mesher.generate_contour(max_edge_dist=5, level=thresh)
mesher.plot_contour()
```

The contours are used as a starting point for triangulation. The triangulation itself is performed by the `triangle` library [@triangle]. Options can be specified through the `opts` keyword argument. This example uses `q30` to generate a quality mesh with angles > 30Â°, and `a100` to set a maximum triangle size of 100 pixels.

```python
mesh = mesher.triangulate(opts='q30a100')
```

Triangulation returns a `MeshContainer` dataclass that can be used for various operations, for example comparing it with the original image:

```python
plane.compare_with_mesh(mesh)
```

## Metrics

Nanomesh contains a metrics module, which can calculate several common mesh quality indicators, such as the minimum/maximum angle distributions, ratio of radii, shape paramaters, area, et cetera. The snipped below illustrates how such plots can be generated (\autoref{fig:mesh_metrics}).

```python
from nanomesh import metrics

triangle_mesh = mesh.get('triangle')
metrics.histogram(triangle_mesh, metric='max_angle')
metrics.plot2d(triangle_mesh, metric='max_angle')
```

## Exporting the data

Data can be exported to various formats. This uses `meshio` [@meshio], a library for reading, writing and converting between unstructured mesh formats.

```python
mesh.write('out.msh', file_format='gmsh22', binary=False)
```

# 3D volumes

The workflow for 3D data volumes is similar, although the underlying implementation is different. Instead of a line mesh, a 3D (triangle) surface mesh wraps the segmented volume. Tetrahedralization is performed using `tetgen` [@tetgen] as the underlying library. \autoref{fig:mesh3d} shows an example of 3D cell data, which were meshed using Nanomesh and vizualized using `PyVista` [@pyvista].
